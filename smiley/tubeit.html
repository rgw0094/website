				<h2>About Tube-It</h2>
				<p>Tube-It is like a cross between Tetris and Pipe Dream. It was on some old console but I couldn't find a ROM and 
				wanted to play it so I just programmed it. Includes new music and a cameo by Michael Angelo Batio.</p>

				<h2>Gameplay</h2>
					<p>In Tube-It there is a constant stream of tubes falling from the sky. Your goal is to prevent the tubes from piling 
					up to the top of the grid!. To accomplish this task you must clear tubes by creating a path from one of the tube 
					resevoirs on the side of the grid to another. When you create a path, all of the tubes in it will dissapear. To create 
					paths you may manipulate the tube grid by dragging and rotating  tubes. To rotate a tube, simply highlight it with the cursor 
					and press space. To drag a tube, highlight it with a cursor and hold space and then move the cursor to the desired destination.
					You may only drag tubes left and right, not up and down.</p>
					<br>
					<p>To make your task easier, the gods of Tube-It will occaisonally bless you with a powerup. To activate the powerup, you must make a tube
					loop using the tube that the powerup appears on. The first type of powerup is 
					<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qG74eVb6V10">Michael Angelo Batio</a>. He will play arpeggios so fast that time will freeze,
					allowing you a chance to clear some tubes. The second powerup is the man from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-5MLPzRjls">Solla 
					Solla Enna Perumai</a>. He will explode, clearing a large chunk of tubes.</p>
